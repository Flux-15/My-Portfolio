            <h3 class="h3_res">Design optimization of BLDC motor using multi-objective plasma generation algorithm</h3>
            <p>In this paper, a novel Multi-Objective Plasma Generation Optimization (MOPGO) algorithm is introduced. It integrates Non-Dominant Sorting (NDS) and Crowding Distance (CD) methods to solve multi- objective optimization problems effectively. The NDS approach preserves non-dominated solutions, while the CD method ensures diversity among solutions. MOPGO addresses key challenges in optimization such as Pareto dominance, solution diversity. This balanced approach achieves superior optimization performance by maintaining an equilibrium between global diversification and local intensification. The consequences for computational efficiency and solution quality are discussed and compared with other notable algorithms like Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), Thermal Exchange Optimization (TEO), Generalized Normal Distribution Optimization (GNDO) and Moth Flame Optimization (MFO).</p>

            <h3 class="h3_res">Optimal coordination of directional overcurrent relays using RIME optimizer (under review)</h3>
            <p>Microgrids and distributed generation (DG) improve conventional power systems, however they interfere with distribution networks' safety measures. Short-circuit current magnitudes are changed by their integration, leading to problems including blind protection, delayed response, and false tripping. Smart protection systems with automatic grid configuration and fault recovery capabilities are needed to meet these challenges. In order enhance directional overcurrent relay (DOCR) settings for any grid configuration without the need for parameter alteration, this study suggests the Rime Optimization Algorithm. (RIME). RIME was particularly superior to Liver Cancer Algorithm (LCA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Moth flame optimization (MFO) when tested on 3-bus, and 30-bus systems. The results show how RIME provides dependable protection system coordination due to its higher convergence speed, adaptability, and computational effectiveness.</p>

            <h3 class="h3_res">Optimal Charging Strategies for Electric Vehicle Infrastructures Using Queuing-Based Threshold Policy (under review)</h3>
            <p>This study presents a queueing-theoretic framework for single-server electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, utilizing threshold-based strategies to enhance system efficiency. The approach incorporates stochastic modeling and Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to dynamically modify service rates when demand reaches predetermined thresholds, thereby minimizing waiting times and optimizing server utilization. Further, numerous system performance indicators are demonstrated to emphasize the efficiency and superior performance of EV charging infrastructure. Further, numerical results illustrate the model's efficacy in addressing critical operational issues, providing a practical framework to enhance EV network performance and consumer satisfaction.</p>
